**Title:** Built a robust E-Commerce API with FastAPI, SQLAlchemy 2.0, and Argon2 - Source Code Included!

Hey everyone!

I've been working on a comprehensive backend for an e-commerce platform using **FastAPI** and wanted to share it with the community. It's designed to be a solid reference for anyone looking to build scalable APIs with modern Python tools.

**Github Repo:** [https://github.com/Sanoy24/fastapi-ecommerce](https://github.com/Sanoy24/fastapi-ecommerce)

**Key Features:**

-   **Auth:** Secure JWT authentication with Argon2 hashing.
-   **Product Catalog:** Hierarchical categories and full product management.
-   **Shopping Cart:** Persistent cart logic.
-   **Orders:** Complete order lifecycle management.
-   **Reviews:** Product rating system.
-   **Docker:** Ready-to-deploy Docker setup.

**Tech Stack:**

-   **FastAPI** (of course!)
-   **SQLAlchemy 2.0** (using the new `Mapped` and `mapped_column` syntax)
-   **Alembic** for migrations
-   **Pydantic** for validation
-   **PostgreSQL** (or SQLite for dev)

I'd love to hear your feedback or answer any questions if you're learning FastAPI!

Happy coding!
